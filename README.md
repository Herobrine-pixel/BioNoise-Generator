# BioNoise Generator

**BioNoise Generator** is a Python application that generates ambient sounds based on your typing rhythm. It uses `pynput` to monitor keyboard activity and `pygame` to play relaxing ambient sounds like rain, wind, or chimes.

## Features

- Plays random ambient sounds when you type
- Simple, responsive, and calming experience
- Fully offline and privacy-safe

## Installation

```bash
pip install pynput pygame
```

## Usage

```bash
python bionoise.py
```

Make sure you have the `rain.wav`, `wind.wav`, and `chime.wav` sound files in the same folder.
